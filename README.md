Wk8: 
This week we went over stacks and queues, as well as their Big-O complexities.  
In Python (v3.4), we created a Node class that extended the rit_object class and 
used it to implement a FIFO queue and a LIFO stack.  The queue required an 
additional class structure to hold references to the front and the back of the 
queue, but the stack only required a reference to the top Node, which in turn
holds a reference to the node immediately below it.
